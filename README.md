# C# Design Patterns: Part 1

This online course can be found on LinkedIn Learning.
I have taken a sneak peak to how some design patterns are built and why those are useful.

The design patterns that were covered in this course are:
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Singleton
- Decorator
- Iterator

What I gathered about those patterns:

Factory Method:
- Allows programmers to request objects and have the correct type created behind the scene and returned.
Abstract Factory:
- It's like the factory method pattern but everything is encapsulated 
- it's a higher level of abstraction
- ultimately a factory for other factories.
Singleton
- Ensures a class has only one instance
- Eliminates the option of instantiating more than one of the same object.
Decorator
- Using composition to limit inheritance and simplify object relationships to make them more manageable.
Iterator:
- Provides a way to access and iterate through collections in the same way, regardless of type.
